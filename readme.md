A spamming-farming bot for multiple accounts in a Telegram RPG

Everything is in Russian, since the game is available in Russian only.

First launch with `python3 main.py session1 -l` then with `session2`, until all of your accounts receive code and connect.
After that start with `python3 main.py separating sessions with spaces -s -r` to have them rebooted and silenced.

Works with `telethon==0.10.1` only, since it is the latest version that supports Markdown, which is greatly needed for sending flags and tags.

If you want to join the Farm Club, read `sessions_example.py`.

Beware!
